  WARNING: multiplayer mode is still incredibly experimental; when playing in
  multiplayer mode, there's no way to recover a game in case of a crash, and
  there are still plenty of game-breaking bugs. If you still want to try it,
  please make sure your connection is good (disconnecting causes one of those
  bugs) and #invite your friends; being engulfed while someone else is on the
  level can also cause a panic - it won't crash the other person's game,
  though - and trying to heal or haste another player will cause one side to
  crash and the other to get stuck, so avoid doing that too; please report any
  weird behaviour you encounter to the #acehack IRC channel on freenode.

  Single player mode should work fine.
