  WARNING: multiplayer mode is still incredibly experimental; when playing in
  multiplayer mode, there's no way to recover a game in case of a crash, and
  there are still plenty of game-breaking bugs. If you still want to try it,
  please make sure your connection is good (disconnecting causes one of those
  bugs) and #invite your friends; being engulfed while someone else is on the
  level can also cause a panic - it won't crash the other person's game,
  though; please report any weird behaviour you encounter to the #acehack
  IRC channel on freenode.
